# README

This is used to convert illustrate to power of `rebar` as an Erlang build tool. This version does not use Erlang releases,
it relies on a custom build script instead.


## Requirements

* Erlang
* Ruby

## Installation

    $: rake
    $: rake run

## Functionality

To see if it runs as expected, issue an curl command as such:

    curl localhost:8080

The response should be `Hello World`!
